### How is Denali different from other CSS Frameworks?
Denali started as a CSS framework specifically for enterprise tools which was unique to the market, but quickly transformed into a themeable CSS framework. We differentiate ourselves by offering the most customizable components on the market.

### What are specific examples of production use and who has adopted Denali?
Denali has been used internally at Verizon Media on several products and a few open-source ones as well. Navi, Screwdriver, and Yahoo Knowledge - COVID Tracker.

### What impact does Denali have on frontend performance?
From our knowledge at Verizon Media, we understand a heavy front end can be costly so one of our main goals is to keep our CSS footprint small. Our web components file size is currently 189kb and theme file ~23kb. We are activity monitoring this file size and will continue to reduce it when possible.

### Will Denali implement other design libraries or is it up to the engineer or designer?
Currently we don't have a solution for our team to implement a design library for teams. We do see this as an issue which we're actively working on a few products that will assit with these needs.

### How do you create a theme in Denali and how do I apply the theme?
Creating and applying a theme in Denali is very easy, but to help teach any we created a step by step theming guide. Check out the [Theme your app]({{ site.data.navigation.static.docs }}guides/themeable) in our guides section.

### What broswers are currently supported?
We currently support modern browsers, but have a plan to support all browsers from IE9 and up. You can learn a little more on our [browser support page]({{ site.url }}/browsers).

### Does Denali offer any JS frameworks?
Currently there is no vanilla JS framework, but we do plan to release a small JS file that helps with the repeatable interactions we use. We are working on a few frameworks for web components such as Ember, React, and Angular.

### Why did Denali go open-source?
We had been working on the Denali design system and design library for about a year when we decided to open-source. The main reason was to share what we had made with all developers globally and to create something that we could all work on together to benefit the front-end community.
