## Guiding Principles
Our color principles were established to ensure that color is used in functional manner that is to communicate meaning and guide users through products effectively.

### Accessibility First
Ensure users with color blindness and/or low vision are able to use your products effectively by maintaining high contrast ratios between colors in your interface.

{% include principles-2-col.html
  do-image='accessibility-do@2x.png'
  do-description='use colors with high contrast ratios next to each other on a screen.'
  dont-image='accessibility-dont@2x.png'
  dont-description='use colors with low contrast ratios next to each other on a screen.'
%}

### Communicate Meaning
Colors often carry inherent meanings that differ depending on cultural associations. It is important to take these inherent meanings into account when using color in your product’s interface.

{% include principles-1-col.html
  do-image='communicate-do@2x.png'
  do-description='use green to signify a successful interaction.'
  dont-image='communicate-dont@2x.png'
  dont-description='use green to signify an unsuccessful interaction.'
%}

### Convey Hierarchy
Color should always be used intentionally to guide users and focus their attention on the task at hand.

{% include principles-2-col.html
  do-image='hierarchy-do@2x.png'
  do-description='use color to emphasize important elements on a screen.'
  dont-image='hierarchy-dont@2x.png'
  dont-description='use color to emphasize background elements on a screen.'
%}

## Color Palettes
Our color palettes work alongside our guiding principles to ensure an effective and logical use of color.

### Brand Palette
The Brand Palette is built around Denali’s blue brand color. These colors should be used on active elements such as links, buttons, and selection controls.

{% include principles-2-col.html
  do-image='brand-do@2x.png'
  do-description='use brand colors for selection controls.'
  dont-image='brand-dont@2x.png'
  dont-description='use colors outside the brand palette for selection controls.'
%}

### Grey Palette
The Grey Palette is palette is built around . We recommend utilizing this palette for foundational interface elements such as such as backgrounds, cards, and containers as well as   and to de-emphasize less important elements on a screen.

{% include principles-2-col.html
  do-image='grey-do@2x.png'
  do-description='use grey to convey a disabled state.'
  dont-image='grey-dont@2x.png'
  dont-description='use a color other than grey to convey a disabled state.'
%}

### Status Palette
The Status Palette is built around the inherent meanings we assign to color. These colors should be used in accordance with their meanings to convey danger (red), warning (yellow), success (green), and informational (blue) messages.

{% include principles-1-col.html
  do-image='status-do@2x.png'
  do-description='use green to convey successful upload.'
  dont-image='status-dont@2x.png'
  dont-description='use yellow to convey a successful upload.'
%}

### Data Visualization Palette
Our Data Visualization palette allows for clear representation of data.

{% include principles-2-col.html

  dont-image='data-vis-dont@2x.png'
