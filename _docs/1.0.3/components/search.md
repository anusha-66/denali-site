### Coming soon
More detailed documentation is coming soon, but in the meantime you can check the milestone progress [here](https://github.com/denali-system-language/denali-styleguide/milestones).

<!-- ### Implementation
Search components are often lumped together with standard inputs, but it is important to emphasize that they differ from standard inputs because they serve a specific purpose and are styled to serve that purpose. -->

<!-- ### Search Icon Inside
A search icon can be added to the right side of the search field by adding the helper classes`.has-icon-right` and `.d-search` to standard icon html. -->

<!-- ### Search Button Attached
A buttons can be attached to the right side of the search field by adding the helper class `.has-button` to standard button html. -->

<!-- ### Dropdown Attached
A dropdown can be added to the left side of the search field by adding the helper class `.has-dropdown` to standard dropdown html. -->

<!-- ### Results
A results container can be added to display autocomplete searches or results “on click.” To add a results container, add a `<div>` with the class `.search-results`. A simple list can be implemented inside the container to organize results by adding `<a>` tags. The container is fully customizable, see advanced results for customization examples. -->

<!-- ### Advanced Results
Again you can completely customize the results in this implementation we implemented a two column results layout. Showing the item and how it is related the the search. -->
