#### **Components**
<span class="chips">New</span> **Fields** Responsiveness - By default input groups are not responsive, but by adding a helper class of `responsive` to the element, will stack the label and input while increasing the width to 100% of the viewport when the screen size is broken down to mobile. [View docs](/documentation/components/fields#responsive-field-labels)
<br><br>
<span class="chips">New</span> **Toggle** Inverse - When a toggle is on a darker background apply `.is-inverse` class to a toggle&#39;s outer `<div>` container. [View docs](/documentation/components/toggles#inverse-toggle)
<br><br>
**Navbar** - We recently removed `.nav-center`, so to replicate it use `.nav-right` and use `.nav-group` to section off navbar sections. [View docs](/documentation/components/navbar#center-section) We also added responsiveness to the navbar by added some classes and elements. [View docs](/documentation/components/navbar#responsive)

#### **Formats**
<span class="chips">New</span> **Containers** - Containers are a foundational layout element. Denali offers a choice between a basic container and a full container. Basic containers can be placed within full containers for added flexibility. [View docs](/documentation/formats/containers)
<br><br>
<span class="chips">New</span> **Rows** - Rows horizontally layout content and are direct children of containers. [View docs](/documentation/formats/rows)
<br><br>
<span class="chips">New</span> **Columns** - Columns must always be wrapped within rows and are used to layout content vertically or horizontally. [View docs](/documentation/formats/columns)
